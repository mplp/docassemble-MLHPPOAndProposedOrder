  Using this tool
subquestion: |
  It should take you between ${ MLH_time_min } and ${ MLH_time_max } minutes to finish answering questions.

  Your Petition for Personal Protection Order and a partly completed Personal Protection Order form will be ready to print after you answer all the questions.

question: |
  Using this tool
subquestion: |
  We are going to ask questions about you and the Respondent, who is the person you want to be protected from. On the court forms, you are known as the Petitioner, the person filing the petition.

  If you are under 18 years old and are not emancipated, you need a "next friend" to file your petition for you. You can still use this tool to prepare your forms.

question: |
  Protecting your privacy
subquestion: |
  To protect privacy, you cannot include personal identifying information in public documents that are filed in court. Personal identifying information includes:
  * Date of birth
  * Social security or national identification number
  * Driverâ€™s license or state identification number
  * Passport number
  * Financial account numbers

  **If a question doesn't specifically ask for personal identifying information, do not include it in your answers.** When this information is necessary, this tool will specifically ask for the information and it will go on a separate non-public form that you will file along with the other documents. This DIY tool will automatically produce that form if you need it.

  Do you understand that you should not enter any personal identifying information unless this tool specifically asks for it?

  If you made a mistake, click **Go Back** to change your answer. Otherwise, click **Exit**. You can use the ${ MLH_GUIDE_FULL } to search for a lawyer or legal services in your area.

  3. A **Personal Protection Order - Nondomestic Sexual Assault** is for someone who does **not** have a domestic relationship with the Respondent.

      A nondomestic sexual assault personal protection order is used to protect someone from sexual assault and/or threats of sexual assault.

id: efile note question
question: |
  Completing this process does not file your forms with the court
subquestion: |
  You need to file them at court in person, by mail, e-mail, or by e-filing.
  If you are e-filing, you must use [MiFILE](https://mifile.courts.michigan.gov/).
  Read the instructions that you will get with your forms for more information.

  ${ collapse_template(am_i_going_to_efile) }

  This tool will create separate forms so you can more easily e-file using MiFILE, if you plan to e-file.

  This means that **you may need to download multiple files to get all of the forms you will need**. At the end of this interview you will see a list of documents to download. Make sure you download each of them. 

  You will also be able to get all forms you need by clicking the **Download Your Form(s)** button on the page at the end of this tool.

continue button field: efile_notice
---
template: am_i_going_to_efile
subject: |
  How do I know if I am going to e-file?
content: |
  Not all courts offer e-filing at this time. To find out if your court has e-filing, read the
  [What is E-Filing?](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/mifile/what-e-filing) article.
  The article tells you how to find out which courts have e-filing and what kinds of cases those courts are accepting by e-filing.

  Look for the two-letter case type code at the end of your case number.
  (This could be DM, DC, DS, DP, or a different code.)
---
id: Electronic signature question
question: |
  Electronic Signature
subquestion: |
  This tool can put "*/s/ ${ users[0] }*" where you would sign your name so you do not have to sign the form by hand. The court will accept this as your signature.

  If you plan to e-file, you may want to add your electronic signature, otherwise you will need to print your forms, sign them by hand, and then scan them.

  ${ collapse_template(efiling_info_template) }
fields:
  - Would you like to add your electronic signature to your form?: esign
