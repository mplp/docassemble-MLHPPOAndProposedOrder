  Welcome to Michigan Legal Help's Do-It-Yourself Personal Protection Order (PPO) tool
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you prepare the forms you will need to ask the court for a PPO.

  A PPO is one tool to help you stay safe. You may also want to talk to an advocate from a domestic violence and/or sexual assault agency, who can help you make a safety plan. A safety plan is a list of ideas to help increase your safety that is individualized for you.

  Protecting your privacy
subquestion: |
  To protect privacy, you cannot include personal identifying information in public documents that are filed in court. Personal identifying information includes:
    
    * Date of birth
    * Social security or national identification number
    * Driver’s license or state identification number
    * Passport number
    * Financial account numbers

  **If a question doesn't specifically ask for personal identifying information, do not include it in your answers.** When this information is necessary, this tool will specifically ask for the information and it will go on a separate non-public form that you will file along with the other documents. This DIY tool will automatically produce that form if you need it.

  Do you understand that you should not enter any personal identifying information unless this tool specifically asks for it?

  What's the difference?
content: |
  1. A **Personal Protection Order - Domestic Relationship** is for someone who has or had a domestic relationship with the Respondent. A domestic relationship means:

    * You are/were married to the Respondent
    * You are dating/dated the Respondent
    * You live/lived with the Respondent
    * You have one or more children with the Respondent

  2. A **Personal Protection Order - Nondomestic** is for someone who does not have a domestic relationship with the Respondent.

      A nondomestic personal protection order is used to protect someone from stalking or harassing behavior.

  3. A **Personal Protection Order - Nondomestic Sexual Assault** is for someone who does **not** have a domestic relationship with the Respondent.

      A nondomestic sexual assault personal protection order is used to protect someone from sexual assault and/or threats of sexual assault.

id: ppo nondomestic intro
question: |
  You have chosen a type of PPO that is for someone who does not have a domestic relationship with the Respondent.
subquestion: |
  A domestic relationship means:

    * You are/were married to the Respondent;
    * You are dating/dated the Respondent;
    * You live/lived with the Respondent; or
    * You have one or more children with the Respondent.

  If you **do** have a domestic relationship with the Respondent, you cannot use this type of PPO. You should select **Undo** to return to the prior screen and choose **Personal Protection Order - Domestic Relationship**.

  If you **do not** have a domestic relationship with the Respondent, you can continue.

    datatype: yesnoradio
---
template: separate_noncontinuous_incidents_explained
subject: |
  What are separate, noncontinuous incidents?
content: |
  There must be at least two separate, noncontinuous incidents of stalking or harassing behavior in order to get a nondomestic PPO. This means that the respondent’s actions against you had to be separate from one another in time and space. Actions that are part of a single event are not separate and noncontinuous. 

  For example, if the respondent approached you, physically harmed you, and then made a verbal threat — and these actions followed immediately one after the other — this would count as only one incident of stalking or harassment, and would not be enough to get a nondomestic PPO.

question: |
  We're sorry, but your answers indicate you don't qualify for a nondomestic (stalking) PPO.

subquestion: |
  You may file your PPO case in any county in Michigan. However, it will probably be most convenient for you to file either where you live or where the Respondent lives, because there may be future hearings to attend.

  If the Respondent doesn’t know what county you live in and you want to keep your location a secret, it’s probably best to file in a different county.

  Be as specific as you can about facts like dates and locations. However, if you are not sure of a date or other fact, do not guess. It is okay to give an approximate date or time, or to put a time of year, like "last summer."

  If you have any documents you want to show the judge, such as police reports, medical records, photos, copies of letters, texts, or email messages, you can attach copies to your petition. However, this is not necessary. The judge shouldn't deny a petition just because you don't have any documents to attach.

  What is a property interest?
content: |
  Michigan law uses the term "property interest," but does not give a definition for it. It doesn't necessarily mean your name must be on the title or lease. We can't know how the judge in your case will interpret the law, but you could argue that the following things make up a property interest:

    * You own or rent the home (your name is the deed/lease)
    * Your name is not on the deed or lease, but you live there with ${ other_parties[0].name }
    * You lived in the home with ${ other_parties[0].name } until recently, but moved out to stay safe
    * A friend or family member owns a house, and you stay there but do not have a written lease
    * Any other property where you live, or lived recently but had to move to stay safe
  
  If your situation is out of the ordinary, use your judgment to decide if you have a property interest in the home. Be prepared to explain your reasoning to the judge, if needed.

  Learn more about stalking behavior.
content: |
  Stalking and/or harassing behavior takes many forms. Generally, stalking is contact you don't consent to that scares you or harasses you. Examples of stalking behavior include:

    * Following you or appearing within your sight
    * Showing up at your home or work
    * Approaching you or confronting you in public or on private property
    * Coming onto property you own, lease, and/or where you live
    * Sending you mail, email, or other communications
    * Calling or texting you
    * Placing or delivering an object on property you own, lease, and/or where you live
    * Threatening to kill you or hurt you
    * Posting a message to you or about you on the Internet, a computer, or any other electronic means

  Your answers to these questions will create the statement of facts to go with your *Petition for Personal Protection Order*. This is important because it helps the judge understand what ${ other_parties[0].name } has done to you and why you need protection.

subquestion: |
  If there is a hearing on your petition, you will be required to testify about the events in your statement of facts, so it is important to tell the truth and be as accurate as possible.

  Be as specific as you can about facts like dates and locations. However, if you are not sure of a date or other fact, do not guess. It is okay to give an approximate date or time, or to put a time of year, like "last summer."

He followed me and grabbed my arm and told me I was not supposed to leave the dinner table without his permission, and that I was a bad example for our daughter. I told him to leave me alone and he pushed me down on the ground and dumped the plate of food on my legs. He told me that one day he would leave me alone for good and I would be sorry because no one would ever want me again."

  This means that **you may need to download multiple files to get all of the forms you will need**. At the end of this interview you will see a list of documents to download. Make sure you download each of them. 

  You will also be able to get all forms you need by clicking the **Download Your Form(s)** button on the page at the end of this tool.

  How do I know if I am going to e-file?
content: |
  Not all courts offer e-filing at this time. To find out if your court has e-filing, read the
  [What is E-Filing?](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/mifile/what-e-filing) article.
  The article tells you how to find out which courts have e-filing and what kinds of cases those courts are accepting by e-filing.

  Look for the two-letter case type code at the end of your case number.
  (This could be DM, DC, DS, DP, or a different code.)

id: Electronic signature question
question: |
  Electronic Signature
subquestion: |
  This tool can put "*/s/ ${ users[0] }*" where you would sign your name so you do not have to sign the form by hand. The court will accept this as your signature.

  If you plan to e-file, you may want to add your electronic signature, otherwise you will need to print your forms, sign them by hand, and then scan them.
