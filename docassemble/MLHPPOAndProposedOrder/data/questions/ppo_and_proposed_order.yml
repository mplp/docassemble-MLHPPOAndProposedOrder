question: |
  Using this tool
subquestion: |
  We are going to ask questions about you and the Respondent, who is the person you want to be protected from. On the court forms, you are known as the Petitioner, the person filing the petition.

  If you are under 18 years old and are not emancipated, you need a "next friend" to file your petition for you. You can still use this tool to prepare your forms.

  Protecting your privacy
subquestion: |
  To protect privacy, you cannot include personal identifying information in public documents that are filed in court. Personal identifying information includes:
    
    * Date of birth
    * Social security or national identification number
    * Driver’s license or state identification number
    * Passport number
    * Financial account numbers

  **If a question doesn't specifically ask for personal identifying information, do not include it in your answers.** When this information is necessary, this tool will specifically ask for the information and it will go on a separate non-public form that you will file along with the other documents. This DIY tool will automatically produce that form if you need it.

  Do you understand that you should not enter any personal identifying information unless this tool specifically asks for it?

  What's the difference?

    * You are/were married to the Respondent
    * You are dating/dated the Respondent
    * You live/lived with the Respondent
    * You have one or more children with the Respondent

  2. A **Personal Protection Order - Nondomestic** is for someone who does not have a domestic relationship with the Respondent.

      A nondomestic personal protection order is used to protect someone from stalking or harassing behavior.

  3. A **Personal Protection Order - Nondomestic Sexual Assault** is for someone who does **not** have a domestic relationship with the Respondent.

      A nondomestic sexual assault personal protection order is used to protect someone from sexual assault and/or threats of sexual assault.

subquestion: |
  You may file your PPO case in any county in Michigan. However, it will probably be most convenient for you to file either where you live or where the Respondent lives, because there may be future hearings to attend.

  If the Respondent doesn’t know what county you live in and you want to keep your location a secret, it’s probably best to file in a different county.

id: safe_contact_info_notice
question: |
  For the following, please enter a **SAFE** address and phone number where the court can contact you
subquestion: |
  **DO NOT** enter an address or phone number that you want to keep confidential, because the address and phone number will be part of the court file and will be on the forms given to the Respondent.

  If you don't want the Respondent to know your current address and phone number, you can use a post office box or the address and telephone number of a relative or friend who has agreed to let you do this.

id: abuse history intro
question: |
  The following questions are about what has happened between you and ${ other_parties[0].name }
subquestion: |
  Your answers will help the judge understand why you need protection.

  Explain the most recent abusive event first, then the next most recent event, and continue in that way. You do not need to list every incident of abuse, especially if there are many. Focus on the most recent events and the most severe events.

  Your answers to these questions will create the statement of facts to go with your *Petition for Personal Protection Order*. This is important because it helps the judge to understand what ${ other_parties[0].name } has done to you and why you need protection.

id: abuse history intro 2
question: |
  ${ other_parties[0].name } will receive a copy of the petition and statement of facts, and they will also be put in the court file
subquestion: |
  If there is a hearing on your petition, you will be required to testify about the events in your statement of facts, so it is important to tell the truth and be as accurate as possible.

  Be as specific as you can about facts like dates and locations. However, if you are not sure of a date or other fact, do not guess. It is okay to give an approximate date or time, or to put a time of year, like "last summer."

question: |
  If you have any documents you want to show the judge, you should attach copies to your petition
subquestion: |
  However, even if you don't have any documents to attach, you can still file your petition. The judge shouldn't deny a petition just because you don't have any documents to attach.

  If you have audio or video evidence, include descriptions about what is in the evidence when you are typing your descriptions of the incidents in the following screens. Save any audio/video evidence you have. If there will be a hearing for your case, you can submit the audio/video evidence to the court directly.

  A poor example:

  "We were fighting and he pushed me."

  A good example:

  "We were eating dinner, and he was complaining that his food was cold. I got angry, so I grabbed his plate and went to the kitchen to put it in the microwave. He followed me and grabbed my arm and told me I was not supposed to leave the dinner table without his permission, and that I was a bad example for our daughter. I told him to leave me alone and he pushed me down on the ground and dumped the plate of food on my legs. He told me that one day he would leave me alone for good and I would be sorry because no one would ever want me again."

question: |
  Completing this process does not file your forms with the court
subquestion: |
  You need to file them at court in person, by mail, e-mail, or by e-filing.
  If you are e-filing, you must use [MiFILE](https://mifile.courts.michigan.gov/).
  Read the instructions that you will get with your forms for more information.

  ${ collapse_template(am_i_going_to_efile) }

  This tool will create separate forms so you can more easily e-file using MiFILE, if you plan to e-file.

  This means that **you may need to download multiple files to get all of the forms you will need**. At the end of this interview you will see a list of documents to download. Make sure you download each of them. 

  You will also be able to get all forms you need by clicking the **Download Your Form(s)** button on the page at the end of this tool.

  How do I know if I am going to e-file?
content: |
  Not all courts offer e-filing at this time. To find out if your court has e-filing, read the
  [What is E-Filing?](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/mifile/what-e-filing) article.
  The article tells you how to find out which courts have e-filing and what kinds of cases those courts are accepting by e-filing.

  Look for the two-letter case type code at the end of your case number.
  (This could be DM, DC, DS, DP, or a different code.)

  Electronic Signature
subquestion: |
  This tool can put "*/s/ ${ users[0] }*" where you would sign your name so you do not have to sign the form by hand. The court will accept this as your signature.
